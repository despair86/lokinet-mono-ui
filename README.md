# lokinet-mono-ui
this is a legacy client ui for [lokinet](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-network) that runs on win32, mono, and .net core v3+.

we have long since transitioned to qt5 based [loki-network-control-panel](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-network-control-panel) for current supported platforms (Tier I), the repo remains for Tier II/III platform support.

this is intended to be used as a submodule for the lokinet repo
